<h3 id="first-search">First Search</h3>
<p>Surname: Lee URL: www.cwgc.org/find/find-war-dead/result?lastname=lee</p>
<p>In this search, I just searched the surname Lee and it unsurprisingly came up with a lot of results from various different countries. After downloading the excel file, I used ctrl-F to find all instances of a Canadian soldier with the last name Lee. What I found is there were a lot of Canadian soldiers named Lee who were on the Vimy Memorial or who had died in Ypres during the First World War. There were also a lot of soldiers with the last name Lee in the Canadian Airforce. I don't know much about my dad's family history, so I don't know if I'm even related to any of these soldiers, so I decided to look at the additional inforamtion column to see if I could find any hints. A few I thought may have been of some relation to me were John J Lee, from the 18th battalion, number 53934, at Ypres, whose father was named Robert Lee. My dad's middle name is Robert, so there could be a connection there. Something else I notcied from looking at the additional information section was that Sarah Lee from Galt, Ontario had lost her sons Frank Walter at Vimy and Sidney James at Ypres. John Lee was also from Galt, so maybe they were related as well? That was an interesting tidbit I found.</p>
<h3 id="second-search">Second Search</h3>
<p>Surname: Trainor URL: https://www.cwgc.org/find/find-war-dead/results?lastName=Trainor&amp;war=1</p>
<p>For my next search, I decided to do a search with something in mind instead to see if I could find something specific. I knew my grandmother had a male relative who had fought in WW1 as a gunner. I searched the last name &quot;Trainor&quot; with the WW1 box checked. I then refined my search to the UK since my grandma's family is from Belfast. I found a gunner named John Trainor, who died at 21. But, it said his family lived in the county of Derry, which is in Northern Ireland, so perhaps this could be him. He was buried at Somme, and I remembered that this male relative was buried in France. So, maybe I found him? I'd need to call my grandma to make sure.</p>

<h3 id="figlina">Figlina</h3>
<p>I searched the word Figlina and found a whole bunch of inscriptions. I don't know much about Latin, but it was interesting to see the pictures of the inscriptions with them transcribed beside them. Some interesting inscriptions I found were one from Bonna (now Germany) Hd number HD025635 and one from Mogotiacum (also modern Germany) HD number HD021363. Overall, this database looks like it would be of more use for scholars who would know a thing or two about Rome, while the CWGC database can be used for a more general audience.</p>
